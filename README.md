### Joe's Resume Site
---
This site is built using Angular 1.2, Bootstrap theme 3.x, and Grunt 0.4.1.
The purpose is to highlight my development skills.
The deployed code should be a single minify/uglify css and js files.

#### Running the site without minify/uglify
```
grunt serve
```

#### Building the dist folder
```
1. grunt build - to create the dist folder
2. grunt serve:dist - to run the dist folder
3. Copy the image, json, and resume folder from the source folder to the dist folder
```
